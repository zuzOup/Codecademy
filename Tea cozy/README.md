# Off-Platform Project: Tea cozy

A website for a fictional café with more complex CSS styling and jump links.

_Add.: This project was made several months before uploading to GitHub and originally I didn´t plan to upload it at all. Please excuse the Czech names and the very obvious mistakes (like multiple divs with the same id) :)_
